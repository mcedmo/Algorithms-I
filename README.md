### Percolation
##### Grade: 92/100
Program estimates the value of percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.  Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations. 

### Queues
##### Grade: 90/100
Dequeue: A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. Uses a doubly linked list.

Randomized queue: A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

### Collinear
##### Grade: 100/100

Program finds every maximal line segment that connect 4 or more points given *n* points.
Uses two methods: brute collinear and fast collinear. Brute will only find lines with 4 points.

### Puzzle
##### Grade: 100/100

The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square. The following diagram shows a sequence of moves from an initial board (left) to the goal board (right). 

Program solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm.
