## Week 2: Queues

### Grade: 90/100
Dequeue: A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. Uses a doubly linked list.

Randomized queue: A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.
